    "Welcome to the Equator Evaluator! This notebook is designed to test state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) either locally or via API. We’ve chosen to use OpenRouter because it’s OpenAI-compatible and provides access to over 276 different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can evaluate local Ollama-based models. With a bit of effort, you can adapt any model—local or remote—that follows the OpenAI API format. Keep in mind that evaluations on local models may run more slowly than those on remote API models, owing to your machine’s memory constraints. Although we run the Equator Evaluator locally, you can also host it on a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluations, we’ll use the OpenAI API to access OpenRouter models. We’ve tested the free models to ensure they work as expected. Remember, local evaluations may still be slower than using an external API. Our official model evaluations will be presented on our website. Meanwhile, we’ll maintain a private list of over 1,005 reasoning and logic questions to guarantee that our results remain unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tool is versatile enough to handle any QA evaluations—including legal, medical, or financial—by simply adding them to the *linguistic_benchmark.json* file. Our project focuses on identifying logical and reasoning shortcomings in LLMs to help strengthen their problem-solving abilities. We’ve found that LLMs can be easily tricked, so our goal is to track their progress until they truly match human-level capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, our next step is to incorporate vision into the Equator Evaluator. We’re also planning to release more advanced, locally-runnable reasoning models soon.\n",

For example if you just want to run the static analysis just comment out the llm_evaluate in the execution list.  You can also set the models you like to evaluate.  We are using OpenAI api call to the openrouter_models.  Change them to the models you like to evaluate.   Open router has about 275 models to choose.  They also have free models which are limited to about 200 calls per day. So you will need to create a paid account and use the none free models to avoid the limitation.  We have evaluated the free models just to test the code and make sure everything works as expected.\n",
